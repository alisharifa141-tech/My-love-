      Hey love, ❤️<br><br>
      I just want you to know how much you mean to me. Every moment with you feels like home, and your smile has this magic that brightens even my darkest days. You’re my favorite thought, my comfort, and my joy all wrapped into one amazing person. I love you more than words can ever fully express, and I feel so lucky that you’re mine. 💌
